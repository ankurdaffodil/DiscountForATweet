Goal:
Make it possible to tweet about a shop and get a discount for it


Actual way to go:
1) We have a Widget with a Twitter-Application
2) User clicks on the Widget, authorizes our application and WE make a tweet for him
3) We write into the session which salesrule the user tweeted for
    (more than one button with more than one rule possible)
4) The user get a salesrule to his quote and has a discount with the checkout
